#### MRFSS Dockside CPFV Index

In short,
From 1980 to 2003 the \gls{mrfss} program conducted dockside intercept surveys of 
recreational \gls{cpfv} fishing fleet. No \gls{mrfss} \gls{cpue} data are available for the years 
1990-1992, due to a hiatus in sampling related to funding issues. 
For purposes of this assessment, the \gls{mrfss} time series was truncated at 1999 due 
to sampling overlap with the 
onboard observer program (i.e., the same observer samples the catch while 
onboard the vessel and also conducts the dockside intercept survey for 
the same vessel). 

\Gls{mrfss} data were dowloaded from the \gls{recfin} Type 3 database, where
each entry corresponds to a 
single fish examined by a sampler at a particular survey site. Since only a 
subset of the catch may be sampled, each record also 
identifies the total number of that species possessed by the group of anglers 
being interviewed.  The number of anglers and the hours fished are also recorded. 
The data, as they exist in RecFIN, do not indicate which records 
belong to the same boat trip. A description of the algorithms and process used to 
aggregate the RecFIN records to the trip level is outlined in the Supplemental Materials 
(“Identifying Trips in RecFIN”).
Trips recorded as having the primary area fished in Mexico or occurring in bays, e.g., 
San Francisco Bay, were excluded before any filtering on species composition.
```{asis, eval = params$area == "North", echo = TRUE, results = "asis"}
The years 1993-1994 were excluded due to limited spatial coverage.
```
The Stephens-MacCall [-@stephens2004] filtering approach was used to predict the 
probability of of catching lingcod, based 
on the species composition of the sampler observed catch in a given trip. Prior 
to applying the Stephens-MacCall filter, we identified potentially informative 
predictor species, i.e., species with sufficient sample sizes and temporal coverage 
(at least 5\% of all trips) to inform the binomial model.  The remaining 
30 all co-occurred with lingcod in at least one trip 
and were retained for the Stephens-MacCall logistic regression. Coefficients 
from the Stephens-MacCall analysis (a binomial GLM) are positive 
for species that are more likely to co-occur with lingcod, 
and negative for species that are less likely to be caught with lingcod.
<<!-- to do reference this (Figure \@ref(fig:fig-sm-mrfss))-->
The top five species with high probability of co-occurrence with lingcod include
Yellowtail, Treefish, Canary, Olive, and Brown rockfishes, all of which are associated with rocky reef and kelp 
habitats. The five species with the lowest probability of co-occurrence were 
Barred sandbass, Kelp bass, Pacific bonito, Squarespot rockfish, and California barracuda.
While the filter is useful in identifying co-occurring or non-occurring species 
assuming all effort was exerted in pursuit of a single target, the targeting of 
more than one species or species complex ("mixed trips") can result in co-occurrence of species in the catch 
that do not truly co-occur in terms of habitat
associations informative for an index of abundance. Stephens and MacCall 
[-@stephens2004] recommended including all trips above a threshold where the 
false negatives and false positives are equally balanced.  However, this does 
not have any biological relevance and for this data set, we assume that if a 
lingcod was landed, the anglers had to have fished in appropriate habitat, 
especially given lingcod is strongly associated with rocky habitat.

The Stephens-MacCall filtering method identified the probability of occurrence 
at which the rate of "false 
positives" equals "false negatives" of 0.35. The 
trips selected using this criteria were compared to an alternative method 
including all the "false positive" trips, regardless of the probability of 
encountering lingcod. 
This assumes that if lingcod were caught, the anglers must have fished in 
appropriate habitat during the trip. The catch included in this index is 
"sampler-examined" and the samplers are well trained in species identification.
Stephens and MacCall proposed filtering (excluding) trips from the index 
standardization based on a criterion of balancing the number of false positives 
and false negatives. False positives (FP) are trips that are predicted to catch 
a lingcod based on the species composition of the catch, but did not. False 
negatives (FN) are trips that were not predicted to catch a lingcod, given the 
catch composition, but caught at least one. 

Initial exploration of negative binomial models for this dataset proved to be 
ill-fitting and the proportion of zeroes predicted by the Bayesian negative binomial 
models were different enough from the fraction of zeroes in the raw data, that 
a negative binomial model was not considered for model selection. We modeled catch 
per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) a Bayesian delta-GLM model. 
Models incorporating temporal (year, 2-month waves) 
and geographic (region and primary area fished (inshore <3 nm, offshore >3 nm) 
factors were evaluated. Two regions were defined based on counties, 1) Del Norte 
to Santa Cruz ("N") and 2) Monterey to San Luis Obispo ("C") north of Pt. Conception. 
For models that span counties north and south of Pt. Conception, Santa Barbara to 
San Diego counties compose a third region ("S"). For models tha exclusively south 
of Pt. Conception, the region represent individual counties. Indices with a year 
and area interaction were not considered in model selection; trends in the average 
CPUE by region were similar in the filtered data set.

A lognormal model  was 
selected for the positive observation GLM by 
a $\Delta AIC$ of 66.36 over a Gamma model and supported by Q-Q plots of the positive observations fit to both distributions.
The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits,
a main effects model including 
YEAR and SubRegion and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and SubRegion and WAVE and AREA X 
was fit for the lognormal model.
The final index if plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:index-fits-all-fleets).

#### Califronia Onboard Observer Survey, 1999-2019

The state of California implemented a statewide onboard observer sampling 
program in 1999 [@Monk2014]. 
\Gls{calpoly} has conducted an independent onboard sampling 
program as of 2003 for boats in Port San Luis and Morro Bay, and follows 
the protocols established in Reilly et al. [-@Reilly1998]. 
During an onboard observer trip the sampler rides along on the \gls{cpfv} and records 
location-specific catch and discard information to the species level for a subset 
of anglers onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a 
maximum of 15 people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  
The catch cannot be linked to an individual, but rather 
to a specific fishing location.  The sampler also records the starting and 
ending time, number of anglers observed, starting and ending depth, and measures 
discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort data allow us to better filter 
the data for indices to fishing stops within suitable habitat for lingcod. 
\gls{calpoly} has modified protocols  reflect sampling changes that \gls{cdfw} 
has also adopted, e.g., observing fish as they are encountered instead of at 
the level of a fisher’s bag. Therefore, the \gls{calpoly} data area incorporated in 
the same index as the \gls{cdfw} data from 1999-2019.  The only difference is that 
\gls{calpoly} measures the length of both retained and discarded fish.  
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are no onboard observer samples from either 
\gls{cdfw} or \gls{calpoly} in 2020.

As described above the \gls{cdfw} and \gls{calpoly} onboard observer programs are identical 
in that the same protocols are followed.  The only difference is that \gls{calpoly}
measures both retained and discarded fish from the observed anglers and \gls{cdfw}
measures only discarded fish from the observed anglers. \gls{cdfw} measures retained 
fish as part of the angler interview at the bag and trip level. This index 
selectivity is mirrored to the recreational 
fleet in the stock assessment model, which represent only retained (dead) 
fish.  Therefore, only retained fish were modeled in this index. The length 
from \gls{cdfw} sampling are contained in the RecFIN database and included in the 
length composition for the recreational fleet in the assessment model. 

A number of filters are applied to these data.  All of the Cal Poly data were 
QA/QC-ed once key-punched, whereas a number of errors remain in the 
data from CDFW.  Data sheets from CDFW are not available prior to 2012 and 
staff constraints have also prevented a quality control review of the data. 

Each drift was assigned to a reef (hard bottom). Hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html), 
with bathymetric data from state waters available at a 2 m resolution.  Reefs were 
developed based on a number of factors described in the supplemental material 
("Reef Delineation"). Depth restrictions in the recreational fishery were fairly 
consistent from 2004-2016. Starting in 2017, depth restrictions eased in districts 
north of Pt. Conception and the recreational fleet targeted these depths. The deeper waters (40-50 fm) are 
outside of the mapped hard bottom habitat, but could be assigend to the larger 
areas considered as a factor in the index.

We modeled retained catch per angler hour (CPUE; number of fish per angler hour) 
a Bayesian delta-GLM model.  Indices with a year and area interaction were not 
considered in model selection; trends in the average CPUE by region were similar 
in the filtered data set.
The delta-GLM
method allows the linear predictors to differ between the binomial and positive models.
Based on AIC values from maximum likelihood fits, 
a main effects model including 
YEAR and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the binomial model and a main 
effects model including 
YEAR and DISTRICT and WAVE and DEPTH bin 
was fit for the lognormal model.
The final index is plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:index-fits-all-fleets).

#### Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Index

The Deb Wilson-Vanedenberg data set is an onboard observer survey data conducted 
by \gls{cdfw} survey in central California from 1987-1998 and referred to as the Deb 
Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, [@Reilly1998]). During an onboard 
observer trip the sampler rides along on the CPFV and records location-specific 
catch and discard information to the species level for a subset of anglers 
onboard the vessel. The subset of observed anglers is usually a maximum of 15 
people the observed anglers change during each fishing stop.  The catch cannot be 
linked to an individual, but rather to a specific fishing location.  The sampler 
also records the starting and ending time, number of anglers observed, starting 
and ending depth, and measures discarded fish. The fine-scale catch and effort 
data allow us to better filter the data for indices 
to fishing stops within suitable habitat for the target species.
A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data 
sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database [@Monk2016]. 

A large effort was made by the SWFSC to recover data from the original data 
sheets for this survey and developed into a relational database [@Monk2016]. 
The specific fishing locations at each fishing stop  were recorded at a finer 
scale than the catch data for this survey. We aggregated the relevant location 
information (time and number of observed anglers) to match the available catch 
information.  Between April 1987 and July 1992 the number of observed anglers 
was not recorded for each fishing stop, but the number of anglers aboard the 
vessel is available.  We imputed the number of observed anglers using the number 
of anglers aboard the vessel and the number of observed anglers at each fishing 
stop from the August 1992-December 1998 data (see Supplemental materials for 
details). In 1987, trips were only observed in Monterey, CA and were therefore 
excluded from the analysis. Sampling 
targeted areas of central California.  Of the 2,256 trips observed, only 12 of 
those launched from port in District 6, which was removed from the analysis.


Each fishing location was assigned to a reef based on the on the bathymetric maps 
and interpretation of hard bottom was extracted from 
the [California Seafloor Mapping Project](http://seafloor.otterlabs.org/index.html).
Reefs were aggregated to four regions produce adequate sample sizes; 
Ft. Bragg to Santa Cruz (V1), Moss Landing to Big Sur (V2), San Luis Obispo to 
Pt. Conception (V3), and Offshore (deeper) locations including the Farallon 
Islands and reefs of Half Moon Bay and Monterey Bay (V4).  The ports in San 
Luis Obispo county were sampled more frequently than other regions and the arithmetic 
mean of CPUE by year was higher also higher in this area.

The final index is plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:index-fits-all-fleets).
