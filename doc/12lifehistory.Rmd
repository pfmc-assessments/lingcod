## Life history

### Geography

`r Spp` are large opportunistic predators endemic to the North Pacific,
ranging from the Gulf of Alaska to central Baja California, Mexico
[@wilby1937ling; @hart1973pacific].
Typically, the center of abundance can be found off
the coasts of British Columbia and Washington State
[@hart1973pacific].
`r Spp` are
demersal on the continental shelf,
display a patchy distribution, and
are most abundant in areas of hard bottom with rocky relief [@rickey1991geographical].
They typically occur at depths less than 200 m but
are caught in the \Gls{s-wcgbt} up to depths of 450 m.

### Growth and maturity

`r Spp` are sexually dimorphic,
with females typically growing faster and
attaining larger asymptotic sizes than males [@richards1990multivariate].
Females also reach maturity at larger sizes [@cass1990lingcod; @miller1973fish]
than males.
Both males and females exhibit a latitudinal trend in
growth, longevity, and size at maturity.
Consequently, individuals from northern waters generally
grow faster, live longer, and mature at larger sizes
than individuals from southern regions
[@richards1990multivariate; @silberberg2001analysis; @lam2019geographic].

`r Spp` are iteroparous spawners.
Male `r spp` aggregate in late fall and move to rocky habitat in
intertidal waters up to 126 m [@giorgi1981environmental; @o1993submersible]
where they guard areas suitable for spawning.
This movement has been correlated with a decline in the proportion of males
in offshore trawl landings in late fall
off California [@miller1973fish], British Columbia [@cass1990lingcod],
and Washington [@jagielo1994assessment].
Mature females are rarely seen on the spawning grounds and
appear to move from deep-water habitats into spawning areas only for
a brief period to deposit eggs [@giorgi1981environmental].
Larger and older females appear to spawn first [@cass1990lingcod],
depositing up to 500,000 eggs in high current areas [@hart1973pacific; @low1978study].
After fertilization, males guard clutches until the eggs hatch
in six to eight weeks [@king2005male; @withler2004polygamous],
between January and June [@jewell1968scuba; @low1978study].
Recent maturity studies suggest that `r spp` are batch spawners with the
ability to spawn year round.
Peak spawning takes place during October through December
(pers. comm., M. Head, \gls{nwfsc}).

At hatching, `r spp` larvae are about 12 mm in total length and
are epipelagic for approximately 90 days,
until reaching about 70 mm and settling to soft bottom habitats
[@phillips1977early; @cass1990lingcod; @hart1973pacific].
Epipelagic larvae feed on small copepods and copepod eggs,
shifting to larger copepods and fish larvae as they grow [@phillips1977early].
\Gls{yoy} typically recruit to sandy, low-relief habitat near eelgrass or kelp beds,
staying on soft bottom until they grow to at least 350 mm in length.
After reaching 350 mm, they move into rocky, high-relief substrate,
which is the preferred adult habitat [@petrie2006hunger; @bassett2018lingcod].

Newly settled juveniles are typically found
at depths ranging from 9-55 m
[@phillips1977early; @miller1973fish; @coley1986juvenile].
They often
start in nearshore areas of sandy substrate [@buckley1984enhancement],
move to a wider range of flat bottom areas by September [@cass1990lingcod], and
then move into habitats of similar relief and substrate inhabited by adults
while ages one to two but remain at shallower depths.
Off the coast of California, they tend to initiate this latter move
starting at around 35 cm in length [@miller1973fish].
Whereas, off the coast of Washington, juveniles have been found in
hard bottom shell-cobble habitat near rocks in 9-15 m of water
off the coast of Grays Harbor as soon as October [@coley1986juvenile].

Juvenile density tends to be higher in the south than in the north
[@tolimieri2020SpatioTemporal].
Particularly, in central California shelf waters (50-240 m)
between $34^\circ$ N and $39^\circ$ N
and, just north of Cape Mendocino and Cape Blanco
between $41^\circ$ N and $43^\circ$ N, albeit at smaller densities.
These results are based on the \Gls{s-wcgbt},
which has an inshore limit of 55 m, and thus,
the results do not account for potential differences
in juvenile habitat in the north versus the south.
Off of Washington,
juveniles have been collected from the mouth of the Pysht River
in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Grays Harbor and Willapa Bay,
and from coastal waters nearshore to these embayments
[@buckley1984enhancement; @jagielo1994assessment].

Juvenile `r spp` feed on small fishes [@cass1990lingcod] including
Pacific Herring (*Clupea pallasii*) and
Pacific Sand Lance (*Ammodytes hexapterus*),
flatfishes (*Pleuronectidae*) including
Shiner Perch (*Cymatogaster aggregate*) and
Walleye Pollock (*Theragra chalcograma*), and
an assortment of invertebrates including
shrimps (Neomysis) and prawns (Pandalus).
As juvenile `r spp` begin to move into rocky habitats and exceed 30 cm,
other rocky reef bottomfishes become a more prominent component of their diet,
making up 48.8\% of total prey biomass by weight [@beaudreau2007spatial].

Phillips and Barraclough [-@phillips1977early] estimated that \gls{yoy} growth
was approximately 1.3 mm day$^{-1}$.
Buckley et al. [-@buckley1984enhancement] reported \gls{yoy} growth from
June to September in the Strait of Juan de Fuca also averaged 1.3 mm day$^{-1}$.
Samples from the mouth of the Pysht River averaged
96 mm in June,
135 mm in July,
173 mm in August, and
200 mm in September [@jagielo1994assessment].

### Habitat use

<!---  to do - make these numbers dynamic if we are going to keep them -->
Outside of the spawning season,
male and female `r spp` are segregated by depth, where
females tend to inhabit deeper offshore waters and
males inhabit nearshore rocky reefs.
Consequently, the sexes are vulnerable to different types of fishing gear.
The majority of nearshore males (66.3\%) are caught using
hook-and-line or spearfishing gear, and
the majority of deep water females (62.4\%) are caught using
trawl gear [@miller1973fish].
Fishery and survey data indicate that male `r spp` tend to be more abundant
than females in shallow waters and
the size of both sexes increase with depth [@jagielo1994assessment].

The movement and migration of `r spp` has been extensively studied
through tag-recapture methods and acoustic arrays.
As adults, `r spp` have a high
[e.g., 95\%, Cass et al. -@cass1990lingcod; and 81\%, Jagielo -@jagielo1990movement]
degree of site fidelity and
tend to stay within an 8 km home range.
Movement is apparent between
coastal areas off Washington and southwest Vancouver Island but
there is little interchange between these areas and
the inland marine waters of Puget Sound and the Strait of Georgia
[@cass1990lingcod; @jagielo1990movement].
However, some exceptional movements have been reported.
For example fish tagged off of Cape Flattery, Washington were recaptured
as far north as Queen Charlotte sound (195 km) and
as far south as Cape Falcon (120 km) [@jagielo1990movement].
One fish tagged as a juvenile was recovered
510 km to the south in Oregon.

High site fidelity was also found using acoustic tags
in Alaskan waters [@starr2005use] and
off of Central California [@greenley2009movements].
While `r spp` exhibit high site fidelity
with an established location of residence,
they frequently leave for 1-5 days traveling around 2 km to feed,
only to return home for a longer duration.
Large females generally had shorter residency times,
spending more time outside of their tagged site.
Additional acoustic studies in Prince William Sound
reported that 50 cm individuals thought to be 2-4 years old
disperse from nearshore reefs during spawning season,
most likely due to displacement by older and larger spawning individuals
[@bishop2010situ; @stahl2014examinationof].
Overall, residency times varied by sex, size, season, and habitat of residence.

### Diet and trophic ecology

`r Spp` are top-order predators of the family `r utils_name("Family")`.
Among the `r utils_name("Family")`,
the genus, *`r gsub("\\s.+", "", utils_name("latin"))`*
is ecologically intermediate
between the more littoral genera *Hexagrammos* and *Oxylebius*
and the more pelagic *Pleurogrammus* [@rutenberg1962system].

Being opportunistic predators, `r spp` feed on a variety of
fishes (pelagic and demersal), cephalopods, and crustaceans [@wilby1937ling].
Their feeding strategies are known to vary with
depth of occurrence, latitude, sex, and size
(pers. comm., B. Brown, \gls{mlml}).
Geographic variation in trophic level is associated with oceanographic factors
such as sea-surface temperature or chlorophyll-a density that
likely corresponds to shifts in prey availability,
suggesting a similar shift in the predatory role of `r spp` in coastal environments.

Male `r spp` caught in shallow depths have more diverse diets and consume
more prey items that are of a lower trophic level (e.g,. cephalopods)
than females caught in deep depths that have less diverse diets and consume
more prey items that are of a higher trophic level (e.g., groundfishes).
Preliminary observations from `r spp` stomach contents sampled from
Washington to California in both nearshore and offshore habitats indicate a
higher occurrence of bony fishes in the diet of northern fish than those
collected off of California
(pers. comm., B. Brown, \gls{mlml}).
Fish collected off of California and southern Oregon had a higher occurrence of
cephalopods in their diet than fish collected from more northern waters.
This latitudinal shift in prey composition suggests differences
in feeding behavior and the predatory role of `r spp` in coastal environments.
Being opportunistic feeders, it is not a surprise that
rockfish biomass in the `r spp` diet increases by three-fold for
`r spp` found inside marine reserves compared to those found
outside of reserves [@beaudreau2007spatial].

### Stock delineation

Longo et al. [-@longo2020strong] used
restriction-site associated deoxyribonucleic acid sequencing
techniques and discovered evidence for distinct
north and south genetic clusters
with the presence of admixed individuals in the region of overlap.
Pure northern-cluster individuals represented
over 80\% of the samples at $42.2^\circ$ N and
all sampled sites that were further to the north.
Pure southern-cluster individuals represented
over 80\% of the samples at all sampled sites south of $35.2^\circ$ N.
Only two sites were sampled within the range where most admixed individuals
were found, $38.6^\circ$ N and $39.5^\circ$ N.
Thus, it was difficult to define a clean break between the clusters.
The general results of the occurrence of two distinct genetic clusters
were contrary to previous genetic work using
mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid that found no
genetic differentiation in the `r spp` population [@marko2007mtdna].

The recent genetic results concurred with results from
recent work demonstrating that `r spp` growth, longevity, and timing at maturity
exhibit a latitudinal gradient.
`r Spp` from higher latitudes are
larger at age (Figure \@ref(fig:Lam-vbgfcurves)),
live longer, and
reach biological maturity at larger sizes
compared to conspecifics from lower latitudes
(Lam et al. -@lam2021geographic; pers. comm., M. Head, \gls{nwfsc}).

<!--- to do - get M. Head figure -->
<!--- to do - change pers. comm. to reference -->

<!--- to do - fix all calls to $\circ$ b/c they are not _accessible -->
This known variability in life-history parameters and genetic structure
led to the reexamination of the previous stock boundary used for `r spp`,
located at the California - Oregon border
[@hamel2009lingcod; @haltuch2019lingcod].
A break point at Cape Mendocino, California ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N) was
chosen for this assessment because it
(1) falls within the mixing zone of the two genetic clusters,
(2) falls in the vicinity of where the greatest difference in
`r spp` size-at-age was detected (Figure \@ref(fig:Lam-vbgfcurves)), and
(3) aligns with the federal management boundary for commercial quotas and
a boundary between two \Gls{cdfw} management regions,
which facilitates the
application of assessment results for future management and
separation of historical catch.
