The initial structural changes from the previous assessment described above 
were made in parallel to both models to provide a
common set of assumptions as a starting place for both models based on 
current best practices and common approaches. Assumptions for the north and south
diverged once the fits to the data and model performance were examined.

Following the previous assessment,
all fishery-dependent indices initially an estimated extra standard deviation parameter
estimated and fishery-independent indices did not. However, the 2004 observation in 
the \gls{s-tri} had a poor fit (while the other points were reasonable, including
those around the transition between early and late periods). Furthermore, likelihood 
profiles over $log(R_0)$ indicated a strong influence of this index on the scale 
of the north model far above the model expectation (as has been the case for this
survey year in many other species), so an extra SD parameter was added to the 
north model for that index.
```{asis, exho = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
Conversely, the extra standard deviation parameter for the Oregon nearshore 
logbook index and the Oregon Recreational Boat Survey index hit the lower bound 
of 0 indicating that the input uncertainty was appropriate for the degree 
of fit within the model.
That parameter was fixed at 0 both both indices.
```

Initial selectivity assumptions had fewer blocks in some cases, but examination of
patterns in the data and the model fits, as well as consideration of the 
management history led to refinements in the time blocks for selectivity and retention.
```{asis, exho = TRUE, eval = ifelse(params$area == "North", TRUE, FALSE)}
The north model also had a number of parameters on bounds that needed to be 
fixed in order to enable good convergence 
(see Section \@ref(sec-model-selection) for details). One of these
that was most problematic was the length at 50\% retention for the 
commercial trawl fleet during the period 1998-2006, which hit the upper bound of 100 cm.
Alternative time-blocks were explored, but did not solve the problem. Increasing the
bound provided a better fit to the discard and retained length compositions for 
this fleet, but a much worse fit to the discard ratios for 2002-2006.
There is no estimablished data-weighting method to balance the tune the 
undertainty in discard ratios so the bound on the retention parameter
was retained to keep the fit to the discards within a reasonable range.

```

Recruitment assumptions were adjusted to account for the additional years of data
but otherwise unchanged from the initial setup.

**to do: Possibly separate following paragraphs into north and south reports separately** 
The biggest difference between the north and south models was in the treatment of
age data. In the north model, ages were available from a large number of years 
from almost every fleet and these were included as conditional-age-at-length 
(CAAL) data to reduce potential biases associated
with non-representative sampling of age structures within the sampled population
(as discussed under the STAR panel recommendations from 2017 in Section \@ref(STAR)).
The fit to the CAAL data was generally good across fleets and time periods in the north
model and the model results were plausible. 

In contrast, the south model 
had sparse sampling of ages in all but the \gls{s-wcgbt} and the fits to
all data sets other than the \gls{s-wcgbt}
were poor when represented either as CAAL or marginal age compositions.
Likelihood profiles and other sensitivity analyses showed that the ages
were strongly influencing the model results and pushing the scale of the estimated
population to high levels. The problems of the age data in the south model
could be due to a number of factors including sparse sampling and variability in 
sampling location, variability in growth over time or space, or misspecification of
some population dynamics process. However, a comparison of the fit to the 
\gls{s-tri} CAAL composition data from 1995 with the ages observed within the 
same length bins in the commercial TW and FG fleets from that same time period
showed strong differences, suggesting that it would not be possible to 
simultaneously fit both data sources within the existing model structure, or 
even a more complex model with time-varying growth. 
Therefore, only the CAAL composition data from
the \gls{s-wcgbt} was included in the south model (which already represented
a majority of the ages) and all other age data were removed. This removed 
the conflict within the model, allowing reasonable 
estimates of population scale while retaining sufficent information about age
at length to provide reasonable estimates of growth.
